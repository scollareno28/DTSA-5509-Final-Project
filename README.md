# DTSA-5509-Final-Project
Final project for Supervised Machine Learning-Drug Classificaiton


The PDF is a Jupyter Notebook of the entire project.  You can also find the dataset that was used 'drugdata200.csv' available for inspection.  
Additionally, the raw Python code is available in this repository.


The purpose of this project was to perform a machine learning exercise in order to predict which type of drug a patient suffering from a particular illness might be using.
There are five different drugs that might be being used and three supervised machine learning models were used: decision tree, logistic regression, and random forest.
